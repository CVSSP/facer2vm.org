The main reason for this is that 3D space is a continuum and so it is not apparent how to represent 3D coordinates in a non-negative fashion.\nThis work compares different non-negative representations for spatial coordinates, and demonstrates that not all non-negative representations are suitable.\nWe analyse the representational properties that make NMF a successful method to learn sparse 3D facial features. Using our proposed representation, the factorisation results in sparse and interpretable facial features.\nDiscovered sparse basis vectors: Presentation This paper was presented at ICB 2016.\nWhen: 13-16 June 2016\nWhere: Visionen building, University of Halmstad, Halmstad, Sweden\nAttachments  Full-text (1.39 Mb) \u0026ndash; cite as:\nWP Koppen, WJ Christmas, DJM Crouch, WF Bodmer, JV Kittler, Extending Non-negative Matrix Factorisation to 3D Registered Data, Proc.
