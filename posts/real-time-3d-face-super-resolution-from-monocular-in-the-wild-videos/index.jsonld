To select the most suitable frames to reconstruct the texture, this work employs a keyframe extraction that selects the best frames and vertices according to sharpness, pose angle and strength of expressions.\nThe system does not need prior training and is designed to work in uncontrolled scenarios.\n  Presentation This work was presented at the SIGGRAPH 2016 poster session.\nWhen: 24-28 July 2016\nWhere: Hall C, SIGGRAPH, Anaheim, California\nAttachments  Abstract (pdf, 411 Kb) with an overview of the work. Poster (pdf, 1.06 Mb) explains the details of the 3D shape-fitting, keyframe extraction and super-resolution.","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://facer2vm.org/"}}
