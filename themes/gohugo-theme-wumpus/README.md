gohugo-theme-wumpus
===================

A nice theme for the static website generator [Hugo][HUGO].

Visually based on the Attila theme for Ghost, but built very differently, adding
support for multiple authors, companies, groups (of companies and/or people).
We've also completely redesigned the HTML structure with pretty neat CSS.
