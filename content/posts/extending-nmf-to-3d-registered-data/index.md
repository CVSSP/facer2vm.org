The use of non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) on 2D face images has been
shown to result in sparse feature vectors that encode for local patches on the
face, and thus provides a statistically justified approach to learning parts
from wholes.

However successful on 2D images, the method has so far not been extended to 3D
images. The main reason for this is that 3D space is a continuum and so it is
not apparent how to represent 3D coordinates in a non-negative fashion.

This work compares different non-negative representations for spatial
coordinates, and demonstrates that not all non-negative representations are
suitable.

We analyse the representational properties that make NMF a successful method to
learn sparse 3D facial features. Using our proposed representation, the
factorisation results in sparse and interpretable facial features.
