We present a new Cascaded Shape Regression (CSR) architecture, namely Dynamic
Attention-Controlled CSR (DAC-CSR), for robust facial landmark detection on
unconstrained faces. Our DAC-CSR divides facial landmark detection into three
cascaded sub-tasks: face bounding box refinement, general CSR and
attention-controlled CSR. The first two stages refine initial face bounding
boxes and output intermediate facial landmarks. Then, an online dynamic model
selection method is used to choose appropriate domain-specific CSRs for further
landmark refinement.

*The proposed DAC-CSR has three stages in cascade: face bounding box refinement,
general CSR and domain-specific CSR.*\\

The key innovation of our DAC-CSR is the fault-tolerant mechanism, using fuzzy
set sample weighting for attention-controlled domain-specific model training.
Moreover, we advocate data augmentation with a simple but effective 2D profile
face generator, and context-aware feature extraction for better facial feature
representation. Experimental results obtained on challenging datasets
demonstrate the merits of our DAC-CSR over the state-of-the-art.
