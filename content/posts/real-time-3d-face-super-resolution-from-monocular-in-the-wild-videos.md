A fully automatic approach to real-time 3D face reconstruction from monocular,
2D, in-the-wild videos is presented.

We use a low-resolution 3D Morphable Face Model to obtain a semi-dense shape and
combine it with a fast median-based super-resolution technique to obtain a
high-fidelity textured 3D face model. To select the most suitable frames to
reconstruct the texture, this work employs a keyframe extraction that selects
the best frames and vertices according to sharpness, pose angle and strength of
expressions.

The system does not need prior training and is designed to work in uncontrolled
scenarios.
