3D Morphable Face Models (3DMM) have been used in face recognition for some time
now. They can be applied in their own right as a basis for 3D face recognition
and analysis involving 3D face data. However their prevalent use over the last
decade has been as a versatile tool in 2D face recognition to normalise pose,
illumination and expression of 2D face images.

It has the generative capacity to augment the training and test databases for
various 2D face processing related tasks. It can expand the gallery set for pose
invariant face matching. For any 2D face image it can furnish complementary
information, in terms of its 3D face shape and texture. It can also aid multiple
frame fusion by providing the means of registering a set of 2D images.

A key enabling technology for this versatility is 3D face model to 2D face image
fitting.


The recent developments in 3D model to 2D image fitting will be discussed. They
include the use of symmetry to improve the accuracy of illumination estimation,
multistage close form fitting to accelerate the fitting process, modifying the
imaging model to cope with 2D images of low resolution, and building albedo
3DMM.

These various enhancements will be overviewed and their merit demonstrated on a
number of face analysis related problems.

*This will be presented as a tutorial at [ICB 2016][ICB],
Monday 13 June from 9am to 12 noon.*
