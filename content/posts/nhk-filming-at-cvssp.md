During the weekend, the Japanese TV Broadcaster NHK came to film an experiment
in face matching, comparing the performance of our face recognition system with
that of a super recogniser, an individual with exceptional ability to recognise
faces, whose company provides services to the UK police in analysing CCTV
videos. The aim of the filming was to produce material for a programme on the
human brain which NHK are putting together for broadcast in February next year,
with an English version to follow three months later.

Our system completed the test designed by Dr Josh Davis, a psychologist from
Greenwich University, with flying colours. Huge thanks to Chi-Ho Chan, the
system designer, for his effort to develop a lot of support software over the
weekend to make our participation in the experiment possible, and for the help
of everybody else involved in the filming one way or another.
