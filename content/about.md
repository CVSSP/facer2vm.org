FACER2VM is a five-year research programme aimed at making face recognition
ubiquitous by 2020.

The project will develop **unconstrained face recognition** technology for a
broad spectrum of applications. The approach adopted will endeavour to devise
*novel machine* learning solutions, which combine the technique of *deep
learning* with sophisticated prior information conveyed by *3D face models*.

Goal
----
The goal of the programme is to advance the science of machine face perception
and to deliver *step change in face matching technology* to enable automatic
retrieval, recognition, verification and management of faces in images and
video.

This will be achieved by addressing the challenging problem posed by **face
appearance variations** introduced by a range of natural and image degradation
phenomena such as *change of viewpoint*, *illumination*, *expression*,
*resolution*, *blur* and *occlusion*, by bringing together leading experts and
their research teams at the [University of Surrey][SURREY], [Imperial College
London][IMPERIAL], and the [University of Stirling][STIRLING].
