Stefanos Zafeiriou is a Senior Lecturer (equivalent to Associate Professor) in
Pattern Recognition/Statistical Machine Learning for Computer Vision in the
Department of Computing, Imperial College London.

He has been awarded one of the prestigious Junior Research Fellowships (JRF)
from Imperial College London in 2011 to start his own independent research
group. He is/has participated in more than 12 EU, British and Greek research
projects.

Dr. Zafeiriou currently serves as an Associate Editor in IEEE Transactions on
Cybernetics and Image and Vision Computing journal. He has been guest editor in
more than four special issues and coorganized more than seven workshops/ special
sessions in top venues such as CVPR/FG/ICCV/ECCV. He has co-authored more than
40 journal papers mainly on novel statistical machine learning methodologies
applied to computer vision problems such as 2D/3D face and facial expression
recognition, deformable object tracking, human behaviour analysis published in
the most prestigious journals in his field of research (such as IEEE T-PAMI,
IJCV, IEEE T-IP, IEEE T-NNLS, IEEE T-VCG, IEEE T-IFS etc).

His students are frequent recipients of very prestigious and highly competitive
fellowships such as Google Fellowship, Intel Fellowship and the Qualcomm
fellowship.
