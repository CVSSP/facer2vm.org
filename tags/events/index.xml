You have to use the script and the provided 7 3D facial landmarks for evaluation. You also should send us back the average error of the reconstructed 3D face for each 2D image.</description></item><item><title>Unconstrained face recognition: Approaches to face normalisation</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/unconstrained-face-recognition-approaches-to-face-normalisation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2016 14:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/unconstrained-face-recognition-approaches-to-face-normalisation/</guid><description>This two-day brainstorming workshop explores the various approaches to unconstrained face recognition. From model-based face normalisation methods to end-to-end deep learning based methods. Also video-based approaches, such as 3D face reconstruction and 3D model fitting, will be addressed.</description></item><item><title>Advancements in Face Research: A Conversation Between Humans and Machines</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/advancements-in-face-research/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2016 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/advancements-in-face-research/</guid><description>The event will cover new and emerging techniques in the area of face research and analysis, providing a means of discussing your research to get feedback from similar fields. This also provides you with an opportunity to brain storm ideas on how to further the current state of the art.</description></item></channel></rss>
