Our DAC-CSR divides facial landmark detection into three cascaded sub-tasks: face bounding box refinement, general CSR and attention-controlled CSR.</description></item><item><title>Efficient 3D Morphable Face Model Fitting</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/efficient-3d-morphable-face-model-fitting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2017 15:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/efficient-3d-morphable-face-model-fitting/</guid><description>3D face reconstruction of shape and skin texture from a single 2D image can be performed using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) in an analysis-by-synthesis approach. However, performing this reconstruction (fitting) efficiently and accurately in a general imaging scenario is a challenge.</description></item><item><title>Facial Recognition for Enhanced Security Applications</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/facial-recognition-for-enhanced-security-applications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2017 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/facial-recognition-for-enhanced-security-applications/</guid><description>Professor Kittler visited New York University of Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) in the United Arab Emirates where he presented a keynote lecture on “Facial Recognition for Enhanced Security Applications” on 7 January 2017.

We use a low-resolution 3D Morphable Face Model to obtain a semi-dense shape and combine it with a fast median-based super-resolution technique to obtain a high-fidelity textured 3D face model.</description></item><item><title>Extending NMF to 3D Registered Data</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/extending-nmf-to-3d-registered-data/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2016 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/extending-nmf-to-3d-registered-data/</guid><description>The use of non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) on 2D face images has been shown to result in sparse feature vectors that encode for local patches on the face, and thus provides a statistically justified approach to learning parts from wholes.</description></item><item><title>3D Morphable Face Model and its Applications</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/3d-morphable-face-model-and-its-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2016 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/3d-morphable-face-model-and-its-applications/</guid><description>3D Morphable Face Models (3DMM) have been used in face recognition for some time now. They can be applied in their own right as a basis for 3D face recognition and analysis involving 3D face data.</description></item></channel></rss>
