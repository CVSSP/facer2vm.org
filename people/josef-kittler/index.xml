From model-based face normalisation methods to end-to-end deep learning based methods. Also video-based approaches, such as 3D face reconstruction and 3D model fitting, will be addressed.</description></item><item><title>3D Morphable Face Model and its Applications (at AMDO 2016)</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/3d-morphable-face-model-and-its-applications-at-amdo-2016/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/3d-morphable-face-model-and-its-applications-at-amdo-2016/</guid><description>Professor Josef Kittler presented an invited paper on 3D morphable face model and its applications at the International Conference on Articulated Motion and Deformable Models 2016, held at Palma, Mallorca during 13-15 July 2016.</description></item><item><title>3D Morphable Face Model and its Applications</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/3d-morphable-face-model-and-its-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2016 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/3d-morphable-face-model-and-its-applications/</guid><description>3D Morphable Face Models (3DMM) have been used in face recognition for some time now. They can be applied in their own right as a basis for 3D face recognition and analysis involving 3D face data.</description></item></channel></rss>
