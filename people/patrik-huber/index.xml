However, performing this reconstruction (fitting) efficiently and accurately in a general imaging scenario is a challenge.</description></item><item><title>Unconstrained face recognition: Approaches to face normalisation</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/unconstrained-face-recognition-approaches-to-face-normalisation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2016 14:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/unconstrained-face-recognition-approaches-to-face-normalisation/</guid><description>This two-day brainstorming workshop explores the various approaches to unconstrained face recognition. From model-based face normalisation methods to end-to-end deep learning based methods. Also video-based approaches, such as 3D face reconstruction and 3D model fitting, will be addressed.</description></item><item><title>Advancements in Face Research: A Conversation Between Humans and Machines</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/advancements-in-face-research/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2016 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/advancements-in-face-research/</guid><description>The event will cover new and emerging techniques in the area of face research and analysis, providing a means of discussing your research to get feedback from similar fields. This also provides you with an opportunity to brain storm ideas on how to further the current state of the art.</description></item><item><title>Real-time 3D Face Super-resolution from Monocular In-the-wild Videos</title><link>https://facer2vm.org/posts/real-time-3d-face-super-resolution-from-monocular-in-the-wild-videos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2016 19:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://facer2vm.org/posts/real-time-3d-face-super-resolution-from-monocular-in-the-wild-videos/</guid><description>A fully automatic approach to real-time 3D face reconstruction from monocular, 2D, in-the-wild videos is presented.
We use a low-resolution 3D Morphable Face Model to obtain a semi-dense shape and combine it with a fast median-based super-resolution technique to obtain a high-fidelity textured 3D face model.</description></item></channel></rss>
